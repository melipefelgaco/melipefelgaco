<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Felipe. Welcome to my personal GitHub profile!</h1>

<br>


Fullstack web developer (mainly TypeScript+ NodeJS) currently improving my frontend/backend tech stack for web dev and having fun with language-agnostic DSA practice exercices as well! 

Paused the Unity C# project for now but sometimes will code for that too, it is fun and will get back to it sooner or later but it is just not the current priority right now



Here's a bird in ASCII:
```

    (o>   KA-CHAW!

 \_/_)
  _|_
```
His name is Ronaldo
