# Current projects/activity: 
- [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in React web 
- A mobile app for matching players of an online game in React Native + Rails + MongoDB (dockerized)
- Taking Harvard's CS50 classes (intro to CS) to get some formal foundation in CS and at least some degree of knowledge in a low level language like C. The course is free and anyone can assign to it [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/)
